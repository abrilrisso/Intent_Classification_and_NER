# Intent_Classification_and_NER
This project focuses on two key NLP tasks for chatbot development: Intent Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER). The first part teaches how to classify user intents from sentences, while the second part helps identify and categorize named entities like cities or dates within text, enabling more contextual chatbot responses.
